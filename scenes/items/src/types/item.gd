# "init" args lmao init is barely even real:
#    name: (string) to set the name of an object
#    type: (enum) to set the type of object i guess
#    action_proc: (func) to replace the shit in InputMap etc
#    ui_sprite: (path) in a sane engine this would probably be inherited
#    character_sprite: (path) see above

# there's no multi line comments in this lol
